# RAG Application

This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application designed to efficiently process and retrieve information from PDFs. 

## What is RAG?

RAG is an advanced machine learning framework that combines **retrieval-based systems** with **generative models**. It enables:
- Efficient extraction of relevant information from large datasets or documents.
- Summarization and context-aware responses to user queries.

By integrating RAG, this application simplifies reading and analyzing data stored in PDFs, making it easier to extract insights or answer questions.

## Repository Structure

- **Python Script**: Contains the DAG logic to orchestrate the application's workflows.
- **`doc/` Folder**: Houses the PDF files used as the context documents for retrieval.

## Key Benefits
- Streamlines data retrieval from unstructured PDF documents.
- Enhances productivity by providing accurate, context-driven insights.
- Reduces manual effort in searching through large document sets.
